This repository has been created for the fulfillment of my Master Thesis. Provided in this repository is the code of a model applied to the data of the municipality of Vaals 
in the Netherlands. It includes also the original NetLogo model and the json and Python files used to generate data for this NetLogo model.
The model can be run using the *main* file. \

### Code and Licensing
This project is based on code originally developed by Lukas Schubotz, published under the Apache 2.0 license. 
Some source files have been modified by Noa Ommering from February 2024 to July 2024.
